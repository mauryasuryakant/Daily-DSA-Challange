ðŸ”¥ Keeping the streak strong â€” letâ€™s go for **Day 7**, one level higher in logic than yesterday but still beginner-friendly and good for array practice.

Hereâ€™s your question ðŸ‘‡

### ðŸ”¹ **Day 7 DSA Question (C++)**

**Topic:** Arrays (Computation + Logic Building)
**Difficulty:** ðŸŸ¢ Beginner

#### ðŸ§© Problem: *Calculate the Sum and Average of Array Elements*

**Question:**
Write a C++ program to calculate the **sum** and **average** of all elements in a given array.
The program should take the number of elements and then the elements themselves as input.

---

#### ðŸ§  **Example Input:**

```
5  
10 20 30 40 50
```

#### âœ… **Expected Output:**

```
Sum of elements = 150  
Average of elements = 30
```

---

#### ðŸ’¡ **Hints:**

1. Use a **loop** to traverse through the array and calculate the sum.
2. Use the formula `average = sum / total_elements`.
3. Be careful with **integer division** â€” if needed, cast to `float` or `double`.
4. Print both the sum and average clearly.
