# 🚀 Daily DSA Challenge

Welcome to my **Daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Challenge**!
This repository is my personal journey to sharpen problem-solving skills, strengthen algorithmic thinking, and build a strong DSA foundation through consistent daily practice.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day’s solution is organized in a dedicated folder, containing:

* Problem statement or reference
* Code solution (in C++ or other languages I’m exploring)
* Notes or approach explanation (if applicable)

Example:

```
Day-XX/
 ├── Question.md
 └── main.cpp
```

| ----- | ------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣   | **Beginner**  | 🟢    | Basic syntax and logic — loops, conditionals, array traversal, or simple patterns. Ideal for warm-up and fundamentals. |
| 2️⃣   | **Easy**      | 🔵    | Straightforward problems requiring direct implementation or basic logic combinations. Builds comfort and speed.        |
| 3️⃣   | **Medium**    | 🟡    | Requires structured reasoning, efficient use of data structures (arrays, maps, sets), or multiple steps to solve.      |
| 4️⃣   | **Hard**      | 🔴    | Demands algorithmic thinking — optimization, recursion, or combining multiple concepts efficiently.                    |
| 5️⃣   | **Very Hard** | ⚫     | Advanced algorithm design (e.g., DP, graph theory, backtracking). Tests deep understanding, precision, and creativity. |
