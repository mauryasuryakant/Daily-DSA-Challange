# 🚀 Daily DSA Challenge

Welcome to my **Daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Challenge**!
This repository is my personal journey to sharpen problem-solving skills, strengthen algorithmic thinking, and build a strong DSA foundation through consistent daily practice.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day’s solution is organized in a dedicated folder, containing:

* Problem statement or reference
* Code solution (in C++ or other languages I’m exploring)
* Notes or approach explanation (if applicable)

Example:

```
Day-01/
 ├── Question.md
 ├── main.cpp
 └── main.exe
```

## 📈 Progress Tracker

| Day | Problem                                     | Topic  | Difficulty  |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------  |
| 1   | Find the Largest Element in an Array        | Arrays | 🟢 Beginner     |
| 2   | Find the Second Largest Element in an Array | Array  | 🟢 Beginner     |
| 3   | Reverse an Array                            | Array  | 🟢 Beginner     |
| ... | Coming soon...                              | ...    | ...         |

## 🎯 Goals

* ✅ Solve **at least one problem every day**
* 🔍 Explore **multiple approaches** for the same problem
* 💡 Focus on **understanding**, not memorizing
* 🧠 Build **strong logic and algorithmic thinking**
* 🏆 Create a **public portfolio** of consistent learning
